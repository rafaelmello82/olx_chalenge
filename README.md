OLX Product Analyst Challenge

Synopsis:
One of our main goals at OLX is to connect buyers with sellers. A reply is when this connection happens.	
With that goal in mind we recently did a change in our homepage search feature for desktop (in one of our products). 
It is now possible for users to filter by more characteristics directly in the home page. This wasn't possible before
The change happened on the 16th Jan and there were some issues with the feature happening until the 22nd Jan.
